# pong

A pong game, written in Ruby using Gosu. Sound effects were created with [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net).

## Running the game

It requires [gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) to run. To install gosu:

```
gem install gosu
```

## Why?

I've been interested in game development ever since I started programming. I've never shipped a real game. So I listed a bunch of simple games I could create quicly and just got started.
This is the first one.

## The Code Sucks! What gives?

The point is to finish something, ship it and move on.

## What's Next?

Probably Breakout.
